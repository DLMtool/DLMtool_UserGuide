<!-- # Frequently Asked Questions -->

<!-- ## How are the biological reference points such as BMSY calculated? -->
<!-- For the historical simulations, the biological reference points (SSB0, BMSY, FMSY, etc) are calculated using the life-history and selectivity parameters averaged over a 10-year period around the current year. For example, the biological reference points at the end of the historical period are calculated from the average life-history and selectivity parameters from the last 5 years of the historical period and the first 5 years of the projection period. -->

<!-- B0, SSB0 and depletion in both the initial and final historical years are calculated from the life-history parameters at the end of the historical period (i.e. the 'current' year). -->

<!-- ## How is stock initialized in the first year?  -->
<!-- The stock is unfished in the initial year. The initial unfished age-structure is subject to recruitment variability and therefore the stock is not at an unfished equilibrium in the initial year, but rather distributed around B0. -->

<!-- ## Can I set the stock depletion level in the initial year?  -->
<!-- The initial depletion can be set using `cpars$initD`, which must be a vector of length `nsim` specifying the stock depletion for the initial year of the simulations. -->

<!-- ## Is the Data collected before or after fishing? -->
<!-- The index (`Data@Ind`), abundance (`Data@Abun` or `Data@SpAbun`), and depletion (`Data@Dep`) are calculated at the beginning of the year before fishing occurs. -->

<!-- ## What is the lag in data collection? -->
<!-- The Data object is populated with data from the previous year. A greater lag in some or all of the data sources can be specified with custom management procedures. -->


<!-- # TroubleShooting -->

<!-- ## OM Documentation -->
<!-- I'm getting the following error when I run `OMdoc()` (or something like it): -->
<!-- ```{} -->
<!-- Error in yaml::yaml.load(string, ...) : -->
<!--   Parser error: while parsing a block mapping at line 1, column 1 did not find expected key at line 1, column 16 -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- This is usually caused by a special character in the first few lines of the Rmarkdown file (eg in Title, Subtitle, Author(s), or Date). -->

<!-- A common culpit is a single apostrophe, usually used to indicate the possessive of a singular noun. -->

<!-- For example, the following will result in an error: -->
<!-- ```{} -->
<!-- # Title -->
<!-- Adrian's OM -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The solution to this problem is to type two apostrophes in place of one: -->
<!-- ```{} -->
<!-- # Title -->
<!-- Adrian''s OM -->
<!-- ``` -->
