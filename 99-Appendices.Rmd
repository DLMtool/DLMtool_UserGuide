# Getting Help

## First Time Working With R?
This section is designed for first-time users of the DLMtool, or users who may not have a lot of experience with R.

You should be able to skip this section if you are familiar with R and RStudio, installing new R packages, and entering R commands into the R console.

To get started with the DLMtool you will need at least two things:

 1. A current version of the R software installed on your machine.
 2. The latest version of the DLMtool package.  

### The R Software {-}
The R software can be freely downloaded from the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/) and is available for all operating systems.  Updated versions of R are released frequently, and it is recommended that you have the latest version installed. 

If you are using Windows OS, you can uses the ```installr``` package and the ```updateR()``` function to update and install the latest version.  Alternatively, head to the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/) to download the latest version of R. 

### RStudio  {-}
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) is a freely available integrated development environment (IDE) for R.  It is not essential that you use RStudio, but it can make things a lot easier, especially if you are new to R.  This User Guide assumes that you are using RStudio to operate the DLMtool.  

It is important to be aware that RStudio and R are two different pieces of software that must be installed separately.  We recommend installing the R software before downloading and installing RStudio.  

## Installing the DLMtool Package {#loadDLM} 
If this is the first time you are using DLMtool, you will need to install the DLMtool package from CRAN. 

### Installing DLMtool Using R Console {-}
This can be done by running the command:
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("DLMtool")
```
A prompt may appear asking you to select a CRAN mirror. It is best to pick the mirror that is the closest geographical distance. 

### Installing DLMtool Using RStudio {-}
An alternative method to install the DLMtool package is to click the *Packages* tab in the lower right panel in RStudio, and click *Install*.  Check that *Repository (CRAN, CRANextra)* is selected in the *Install from:* drop-down menu, type **DLMtool** into the *packages* dialog box, and click *Install*. 

The DLMtool package relies on a number of other R packages, which the installation process will automatically install.  The number of packages that are installed, and the time it takes, will depend on what packages you already have installed on your system (and your download speed).

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/RStudioInstallPackage.png")
```

### Updating the DLMtool Package {-}
You will only need to install the DLMtool package once. However, the DLMtool package is updated from time to time, and you will need to re-install from CRAN for each new version. 

This can be done by using the `update.packages` command: 
```{r eval=FALSE}
update.packages("DLMtool")
```

### Loading the DLMtool Package {-}
Once installed, the DLMtool package can be loaded into R by typing in the command line:
```{r}
library(DLMtool)
```
or locating the *DLMtool* package in the list of packages in RStudio and checking the box.


## A Brief Note on S4 Methods 
The core functions of DLMtool are *S4 Classes*. Many R users may not have worked with S4 methods before. 

R has three different object oriented (OO) systems, the most common of which is known as **S3**.   S3 is known as a generic-function OO, and is a casual system with no formal definition of classes.  **S4** works similar to S3, but is more formal and uses classes with a more rigid definition.  

It is not essential to understand the difference between S3 and S4, or why one is preferred over the other, to use the DLMtool.  The most important thing that you need to know how to access the information in S4 classes. 

If you have work with R in the past, you are probably familiar with using the **$** symbol to access elements in a data frame or list.  S4 classes contain a named list of **slots** which are analogous to a standard R list.  However, the slots in a S4 class differ in two important ways:

1. The type of content in each slot (e.g., character, numeric, matrix) is determined in the class definition, and cannot be changed.  In other words, you are not able to put content of class ```character``` into a slot that is expecting information of class ```numeric```.  This is what is meant by the S4 system being more strict than S3.   
2. The slots are accessed with the @ symbol.  This is essentially the same as the **$** symbol in S3 classes.  You will see examples of this throughout the User Guide.

The main thing to note here is that when you see the `@` symbol being used, it refers to some particular information (a *slot*) being accessed from a larger collection of data (the *object*).

For further information on the S3 and S4 systems see [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/).


## Additional Help on the DLMtool 
This User Guide aims to explain the workings of the DLMtool, and address the most common questions and issues associated with the package.

Additional help material for the DLMtool package and functions can be obtained in the usual way:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
help(DLMtool)
```

Documentation for each function can be obtained by typing a ? symbol followed by the function name. For example:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?runMSE
```

Information on the DLMtool classes can be found by first typing ```class``` followed by the ? symbol and the class name.  For example:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
class?Data
```

You can access this user guide at any time from the R console:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
userguide()
```



## Questions on R-related Problems 
Although the User Guide attempts to address the most common issues, undoubtedly there will be times where you have problems with your R code.  R has a somewhat annoying habit of returning cryptic error messages, that are sometimes indecipherable, especially to those who are new to the software.

Most coding problems with the R language are the result of a missing parenthesis, an extra or missing comma or quotation mark, or some other minor typo that stops your code from running.  

There are a number of resources available on the Internet that are devoted to dealing with questions and problems with R programming. [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) is great place to start searching for answers to your R-related problems. 

There is a high chance that in the past someone has posted the exact question that you are dealing with, and one or several kind souls have provided helpful solutions. If not, you can post your own question. But be aware, the StackOverflow community is made up entirely of people who volunteer their time to help others, and they sometimes have little patience for questions that don't demonstrate a proper search for already posted answers to the problem.






# Assumptions of DLMtool

Like all models, DLMtool is a simplication of reality. In order to approximate real fishery dynamics, DLMtool relies on a number of simplifying assumptions.

Some of these assumptions are common to many fishery science models (e.g., age-structured population dynamics) and are a central to the structure of DLMtool. Other assumptions are a result of the way DLMtool was designed and developed, and may represent limitations of DLMtool for applications to particular situations. It may be possible to deal with some of these assumptions by further development of DLMtool.

## Biology 
### Short-Lived Species {-}
Due to the problems with approximating fine-scale temporal dynamics with an annual model it is not advised to use the DLMtool for very short lived stocks (i.e., species with a longevity of 5 years or less).

Technically, you could just divide all temporal parameters by a subyear resolution, but the TAC would be set by sub year and the data would also be available at this fine-scale which is highly unlikely in a data-limited setting.

A MSE model with monthly or weekly time-steps for the population dynamics is required for short-lived species, and may be developed in the future.

### Density-Dependent Compensation {-}
DLMtool assumes that, with the exception of the stock-recruitment relationship, there is no density-dependent compensation in the population dynamics, and fish growth, maturity, and mortality does not change directly in response to changes in stock size.

### von Bertalanffy Growth {-}
Growth model in DLMtool is modelled using the von Bertalanffy growth curve. While this is the most commonly applied model to describe fish growth, it may not be the preferred growth model for some species. The consequences of assuming the von Bertalanffy growth model should be considered when using the DLMtool for species with alternative growth patterns. Since DLMtool V4.4 it is possible to use alternative length-at-age models by using `cpars`. See the [Custom Parameters] chapter for more information. 

### Natural Mortality Rate at Age {-}
By default DLMtool assumes that natural mortality (*M*) is constant with age and size. Since DLMtool V4.4 size or age-specific M can be specified. See the [Size-Specific Natural Mortality] chapter for more information.


## MSE Model Assumptions 

### Retention and Selectivity {-}
The OM has slots for both gear selectivity and retention by size. If the retention slots are not populated, it is assumed that retention = selectivity, that is, all fish that are captured by the gear are retained by the fishers. 

Most size-regulation MPs (e.g., `matlenlim`) change the retention pattern and leave the selectivity pattern unchanged. For example, if a size limited is regulated well above the current size of selection, fish smaller than the size limit are still caught by the gear but are discarded and may suffer some fishing mortality (Stock@Fdisc). 

MPs can be designed to modify gear selectivity instead of, or in addition to, the retention-at-size. 

### Non-Convergence of Management Procedure {-}
In some cases during the MSE Management Procedure may not be able to successfully calculate a management recommendation from the simulated data. For example, a catch-curve may used to estimate $Z$, and $F$ is calculated as $F=Z-M$. Because of process and observation error, it is possible that the estimated $F$ is negative, in which case the MP may fail to calculate a recommended catch limit. 

The Management Procedures have been designed to return `NA` if they fail to calculate a management recommendation for any reason. In this case, the management recommendations from the previous year are used in the simulation, e.g., $\text{TAC}_y = \text{TAC}_{y-1}$.


### Idealised Observation Models for Catch Composition Data {-}
Currently, DLMtool simulates catch-composition data from the true simulated catch composition data via a multinomial distribution and some effective sample size. This observation model may be unrealistically well-behaved and favour those approaches that use these data. We are considering adding a growth-type-group model to improve the realism of simulated length composition data.

### Two-Box Model {-}
DLMtool uses a two-box spatial model and assumes homogeneous fishing, and distribution of the fish stock. That is, growth and other life-history characteristics do not vary across the two spatial areas. Spatial targeting of the fishing fleet is currently being developed in the model.

### Ontogenetic Habitat Shifts {-}
Since the operating model simulates two areas, it is possible to prescribe a log-linear model that moves fish from one area to the other as they grow older. This could be used to simulate the ontogenetic shift of groupers from near shore waters to offshore reefs. Currently this feature is in development.

### Closed System {-}
DLMtool assumes that the population being modelled is in a closed system. There is no immigration or emigration, and a unit stock is assumed to be represented in the model and impacted by the management decisions. This assumption may be violated where the stock extends across management jurisdictions. Violations of this assumption may impact the interpretation of the MSE results, and these implications should be considered when applying DLMtool.

Although a unit stock is a central assumption of many modeling and assessment approaches, it may be possible to further develop DLMtool to account for stocks that cross management boundaries.


## Management Procedures 
### Harvest Control Rules Must be Integrated into Data-Limited MPs {-}
In this version of DLMtool, harvest control rules (e.g. the 40-10 rule) must be written into a data-limited MP. There is currently no ability to do a factorial comparison of say 4 harvest controls rules against 3 MPs (the user must describe all 12 combinations). The reason for this is that it would require further subclasses.

For example the 40-10 rule may be appropriate for the output of DBSRA but it would not be appropriate for some of the simple management procedures such as DynF that already incorporate throttling of TAC recommendations according to stock depletion.

## Data and Method Application
### Data Assumed to be Representative {-}
The MSE model accounts for observation error in the simulated fishery data. However, the application of management procedures for management advice assumes that the provided fishery data is representative of the fishery and is the best available information on the stock. Processing of fishery data should take place before entering the data into the fishery data tables, and assumptions of the management procedures should be carefully evaluated when applying methods using DLMtool.


# Changes


### Important changes - DLMtool V4.1 and greater {-}
DLMtool V4.1 introduced some important changes to the Operating Model object. The number of simulations (`nsim`) and the number of projection years (`proyears`) are now slots in the `OM` object, rather than arguments to `runMSE` (see [Management Strategy Evaluation]). This change was required to allow users to specify their own custom futures for parameters like *M*, growth, etc. The `OM` object also now has a new random seed slot in the operating model, which ensures that the MSE results are now exactly reproducible.

You can modify the number of simulations, the number of projection years, or the value of the random seed by modifiying the relevant slots in the `OM` object:

- `OM@nsim`
- `OM@proyears`
- `OM@seed`

### Important changes - DLMtool V4.5 and greater {-}
Since DLMtool V5.0 the following slots have been added to the OM object:

- `OM@interval`
- `OM@pstar`
- `OM@maxF`
- `OM@reps`

This was done so that an OM object is completely self-contained and includes all information used in the MSE.
