# Prerequisites to Using DLMtool {#preq}

At the start of every session there are a few things to do: 
1. Load the DLMtool library. 
2. Make the data available. 
3. Set up parallel computing.

The following steps must be run every time the DLMtool is used in a new R session:

1. Load the Library - At the beginning of every session you must load the DLMtool library:
```{r loadlibrary, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(DLMtool)
```

2. Set up parallel processing:
```{r setup, include=FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
setup()
```

```{r setup2, eval=FALSE}
setup()
```

The above steps need to be done each time you start a new instance of R/RStudio and use the DLMtool. It is recommended that you start a new instance of R (by restarting RStudio) each time you begin a new analysis.
